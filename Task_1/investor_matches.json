        "Stage Alignment":"Good.  Investor invests in Seed stage, which aligns with the founder's stage.",
        "Funding Alignment":"Good. Founder's funding requirement ($1M) falls within the investor's cheque range ($100K - $3M).",

Presenting a detailed financial model showcasing long-term profitability would further strengthen the pitch.
